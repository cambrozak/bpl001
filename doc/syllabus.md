##Course Description

The field of Robotics is at a fascinating and exciting point in its evolution.
Robots are no longer confined to the realms of industry and research,
they are rapidly becoming a part of daily life.

This course provides Middle School students with an introduction
to fundamental concepts and practical application of tools and techniques for building robotic systems
in order to inspire further study and participation in High School and College programs.

Hands-on laboratory exercises and short lectures explore
programming, circuits, embedded systems, motors, sensors and servos.

##Prerequisites

None!  This class is for motivated beginners.

##Objectives

* Have Fun!
* Write lots of programs to provide a robot with interesting autonomous behaviours
* Understand the fundamentals of electricity and circuits
* Hands-on experience with robot hardware: embedded systems, LCDs, sensors, gyros, accelerometers, motors, servos, cameras
* Connect concepts to robots in the real world 

##Teaching and Learning Styles

Technical subjects are often presented bottom-up, in a way that favors visual/abstract learning over audio/kinesthetic styles.   

This course takes a holistic approach to learning styles
by presenting the subject in a broad top-down manner
and filling in bottom-up details with applicable hands-on laboratory exercises.

This approach enables beggining students to engage all learning modes, learn through experience and become effective with the technology immediately.

##Class Format
Each classroom session follows a *Lab-Lecture-Lab* format:

A simple lab exercise is completed as a group to start the session.
Students follow along with the instructor to load prewritten software,
connect components to the Robot and observe resulting physical behavior.
The sesssion does not proceed until every Robot is performing as expected.

A short lecture explains how and why the lab exercise worked and answers open questions.
The lecture also connects the lab exercise to examples in the real world.

A final lab exercise challenges students to implement their own original ideas
by combining the first lab with previous learning.

##Class Values and Conduct

1. Win together by sharing and listening thoughtfully to ideas.
2. Handle delicate equipment with care and safety.
3. Fun is Mandatory.
