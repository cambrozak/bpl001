#Session Two: Intro to Programming, Movement with Motors, Positioning with Compass and Gyroscope

###Lab: Move the Robot, Edge Detection, Motor Control with Libraries & APIs (15min)
####_**Objective: Students load and manipulate a simple program that moves the Robot back and forth within a boundary line**_
**Activity:** Students follow along with Instructor to add basic roaming behavior to the movement program<br>

###Lecture: Intro to Programming with C and Python (30min)
####_**Objective: Students understand fundamental programming concepts: Expressions, Syntax**_
**Activity:** Instructor explains Expressions, Syntax and compare/contrasts live examples with the C and Python programming languages<br>
**Activity:** Students identify invalid Expressions and invalid Syntax in a short exercise with the IDE

###Lab: Turn the Robot, Speed control, Positioning with the Gyro and Compass (45min)
####_**Objective: Students work with Variables, If/Then logic and Loops to add turning, speed control and positioning behavior to the movement program from the first lab**_
**Activity:** Instructor and Students adjust speed by instantiating new Variables in the momvement program<br>
**Activity:** Instructor and Students tune border detection behavior manipulate using If/Then logic expressions<br>
**Activity:** Students create flow chart with Instructor to design roaming behavior and implement the design in the movement program<br>
**Activity:** Instructor and Students control position with the Gyro and Compass using For Loops and While Loops
