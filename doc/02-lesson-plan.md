#Session Two: Intro to Programming, Movement with Motors

###Lab: Move the Robot, Edge Detection, Program motor control using libraries & APIs (15min)
####_**Objective: Students load and manipulate a simple program that moves the Robot
back and forth within a boundary line**_####
**Activity:** Students follow along with Instructor to add roaming behavior to the simple movement program<br>

###Lecture: "Intro to Programming with C and Python" (30min)
####_**Objective:** Students understand fundamental programming concepts: Expressions, Syntax**_####
**Activity:** Instructor explains Expressions, Syntax, provides live examples with the C and Python programming languages
**Activity:** Students identify invalid Expressions invalid Syntax in short exercise with the IDE

###Lab: Turn the Robot, Speed control, Positioning with the Gyro and Compass. (45min)
####_**Objective: Students **_####
####_**Objective: Students work with Variables, If/Then logic and Loops to add turning, speed control and positioning behavior to the movement program from the first lab**_####
**Activity:** Students follow along with Instructor to add roaming behavior to the movement program<br>
**Activity:** Instructor and Students instantiate new Variables in the momvement program to adjust speed<br>
**Activity:** Instructor and Students manipulate If/Then statements to adjust border detection behavior<br>
**Activity:** Instructor and Students use For Loops and While Loops to control position with the Gyro and Compass
