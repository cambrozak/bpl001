#Session Two: Introduction to Programming, Movement with Motors, Basic Autonomous Roaming with Reflectance Sensors

###Lab: Move the Robot, Turn the Robot, Speed Control, Motor Control with Libraries & APIs (15min)
####_**Objective: Students load and manipulate a simple program that moves the Robot forward, reverse and turns left and right.**_
**Activity:** Students follow along with Instructor to adjust speed and turning behavior in the movement program<br>

###Lecture: Introduction to Programming with C and Python (30min)
####_**Objective: Students understand fundamental programming concepts: Expressions, Syntax**_
**Activity:** Instructor explains Expressions, Syntax and compare/contrasts live examples with the C and Python programming languages<br>
**Activity:** Students identify invalid Expressions and invalid Syntax in a short exercise with the IDE

###Lab: Edge Detection, IR LED/Phototransistor input processing, Basic Autonomous Roaming (45min)
####_**Objective: Students use Variables, If/Else Logic, Switch Statements and Loops to process reflectance sensor input and implement basic roaming behavior**_
**Activity:** Instructor and Students use a For Loop to distinguish black/white edges with Reflectance Sensor inputs<br>
**Activity:** Instructor and Students design roaming behavior with a Flow Chart and implement the design in the edge explorer program<br>
**Activity:** Instructor and Students tune edge detection behavior with If/Else and Switch logic expressions
