#Session Three: Line Following, More Programming, The Art of Debugging

###Lab: Line Following (15min)
####_**Objective: Students load and manipulate a simple program that uses Phototransistor inputs to follow lines**_
**Activity:** Students follow along with Instructor to add basic maze solving behavior to the line following program using the Wall Follower Algorithm<br>

###Lecture: More Programming Concepts with C and Python (15min)
####_**Objective: Students understand fundamental programming concepts: Scope, Functions**_
**Activity:** Instructor explains Scope, Functions and compare/contrasts live examples with the C and Python programming languages<br>
**Activity:** Students identify Scope levels in a short exercise with the IDE<br>
**Activity:** Students and Instructor redesign the Wall Follower implementation from the first lab into a set of Functions


###Lecture: The Art of Debugging (15min)
####_**Objective: Students empowered with Debugging Heuristics and view Debugging as a Learning Opportunity**_
**Activity:** Instructor presents an attitude towards Debugging as a Learning Opportunity vs the common DABDA Response<br>
**Activity:** Instructor and Students discuss complementary Heuristics: Murphy's Law, Sherlock's Law<br>
**Activity:** Instructor and Students debug broken flashlights.  Diagnoses are logged on the board and extrapolated into a General Debug Checklist

###Lab: Debugging in Practice (45min)
####_**Objective: Students extend the General Debug Checklist by troubleshooting the Line Following program from the first lab with the IDE and Simulator**_

General Debug Checklist (completed version)

**Hardware**
- [ ] Power:  Is power on?  Are batteries charged?
- [ ] Mechanics: Are moving parts inhibited?
- [ ] Components: Are components fried or broken?

**Software**
- [ ] Upload: Is the software loaded?
- [ ] Bottom Up: Is a stack trace available?
- [ ] Top Down: Divide and conquer the execution path with debug statements to isolate problem area 
- [ ] Step Through: Use IDE and/or Simulator to step through code execution

**Environment**
- [ ] Is the IDE configured correctly?
- [ ] Is the Operating System running the IDE properly?
- [ ] Do files and directories have the right permission settings?

**Electrical** 
- [ ] Short Circuits, Open Circuits, Grounded Circuits (covered in next class)
- [ ] Multimeter, Oscilloscope, Logic Analyzer (mentioned but not covered)
