#Session Three: More Programming, Debugging, Line Following

###Lab: Line Following (15min)
####_**Objective: Students load and manipulate a simple program that uses Phototransistor inputs to follow lines**_
**Activity:** Students follow along with Instructor to add basic maze solving behavior to the line following program using the Wall Follower Algorithm<br>

###Lecture: More Programming Concepts with C and Python (15min)
####_**Objective: Students understand fundamental programming concepts: Scope, Functions**_
**Activity:** Instructor explains Scope, Functions and compare/contrasts live examples with the C and Python programming languages<br>
**Activity:** Students identify Scope levels in a short exercise with the IDE<br>
**Activity:** Students and Instructor redesign the Wall Follower implementation from the first lab into a set of Functions


###Lecture: The Art of Debugging (15min)
####_**Objective: Students empowered with Debugging Heuristics and view Debugging as a Learning Opportunity**_
**Activity:** Instructor presents an attitude towards Debugging as a Learning Opportunity vs the common DABDA Response<br>
**Activity:** Instructor and Students discuss complementary Heuristics: Murphy's Law, Sherlock's Law
**Activity:** Instructor and Students debug broken flashlights, diagnosis' are on the board and extrapolated into a General Debug Checklist

###Lab: Debugging in Practice (45min)
####_**Objective: Students extend the General Debug Checklist by debugging various scenarios on the Robot with the IDE and Simulator**_

General Debug Checklist (completed version)

**Hardware**
[ ] Power:  Is power on?  Are batteries charged?
[ ] Mechanics: Are moving parts inhibited?
[ ] Components: Are components visibly fried or broken?

**Software**
[ ] Upload: Is the software loaded?
[ ] Bottom Up: Is a stack trace available?
[ ] Top Down: Divide and conquer the code path with debug statements to isolate problem area 
[ ] Step Through: Use IDE and/or Simulator to step through code execution

**Environment**
[ ] Is the IDE configured correctly?
[ ] Is the Operating System running the IDE properlty?

**Electrical** (Mentioned, but not covered by this course)
[ ] Multimeter, Oscilliscope, Logic Analyzer
