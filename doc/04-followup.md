Awesome session today!  You *built a battery from scratch with your bare hands* and used it to push [electrons](https://youtu.be/0fKBhvDjuy0?t=351)
through an LED to light it up.  Some of you expressed interest in
continuing to study the battery at home.  Look for another email after this
one with links to purchase the materials and instructions.

The rickety toothpick frame may have prevented some of you from seeing
light due to gaps between the cells, but the oscilloscope showed the
voltage jump even from just one cell and everyone had the right
configuration so it's my bad if you were unable to get light, I need to
redesign the frame.

**Circuit Fundamentals**

You observed first hand the effect of connecting the batteries in Series
and again in Parallel.

You know what a Diode is and that electrons can only move thru it in one
direction.

There was great dialog and questions about the three types of circuit
failures, especially about important safety implications: [Short Circuits, Open Circuits and Grounded Circuits](https://youtu.be/3hyMggzguwY?t=93).

**Four Ways to Move Electrons**

This session focused on Chemical batteries and we mentioned Friction.  You
were also able to handle live examples of Magnetic and Photovoltaic
generators and we discussed how Magnetic generators are the primary means
of moving electrons into your house; be they turned by nuclear, coal, wind,
hydro, hand-crank (like the one in class) or even donkeys!

The Marble Run model provided a simple example of what's happening
physically when electrons move and set the foundation for understanding the
concept of [Voltage as the force that kicks electrons causing movement which is Current](http://i.imgur.com/p2dDviT.jpg).  This is the foundation of
Electronics and the lifeblood of all robots.

There are many things to learn about electronics going forward and it's a
vast topic that can seem daunting because of all the math and theory.
Always wire up simple circuits to test what you're learning and keep it
fun.  Learn about Resistance next by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYS9kdS56l8).  When you feel comfortable
with Voltage, Current and Resistance, move on to [Inductance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgwXkUt3XxQ)
and [Capacitance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic_yEUV7Y3c).  Fall back on what you
learned today whenever an electronic concept seems puzzling.  All of it
boils down to where the electrons are and how they're moving :)

**Additional Topics**

A couple of you asked about general computing and State Machines.  Review
the slides and attempt the Algorithm Challenge from the last email.  The
table in the slides with Sensors/Next-Action *is a state machine* and we'll
be coding up some more of these going forward, so please do the challenge.
You may attempt to code up your algorithm, but just doing the challenge on
paper will be enlightening.  Send me email if you have any questions or
need me to resend links to the slides and instructions for the challenge.

See you next week!
