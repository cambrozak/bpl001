#Session Four: Electricity, Circuits

###Lab: Build a Battery (30min)
####_Objective: Students construct a battery from common components_
**Activity:** Students follow along with Instructor to build a small Voltaic Pile battery using basic cells composed of copper discs, zinc washers and vinegar pads<br>
**Activity:** Students use a Multimeter to observe Voltage and Current changes with the addition of each voltaic cell to the pile<br>
**Activity:** Students use their custom made battery to light LEDs


###Lecture: Introduction to Electricity -- Electrons, Current, Voltage, Series, Parallel, Ground (30min)
####_Objective: Students have a basic understanding of Electrons, Current, Voltage, Series, Parallel, Resistance, Ground_
**Activity:** Instructor defines and demonstrates the relationship between Electrons, Current, Voltage, Resistance and Ground using a simple marble run model<br>
**Activity:** Students understand the atomic scale at which electron flow takes place by
viewing the second part of Eames film, [Powers of Ten](https://youtu.be/0fKBhvDjuy0?t=351)<br>
**Activity:**  Instructor defines Ground, Series and Parrallel with examples drawn on the board

###Lab: Series, Parallel, Ground, Circuit Debugging (30min)
####_Objective: Students get hands-on experience with Series/Parallel circuits and debugging three common types of circuit failures: Shorts, Grounded, Open_
**Activity:** Students pair up and connect their batteries in series and parrallel, use a Multimeter to observe Voltage and Current changes<br>
**Activity:** Students follow along with Instructor to construct a reference circuit on a breadboard<br>
**Activity:** Students get familiar with three common circuit failure modes by
shorting, grounding and opening their reference circuits on purpose, observing and measuring with a Multimeter
