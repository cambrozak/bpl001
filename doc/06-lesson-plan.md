#Session Six: Servo Mechanical Control

###Lab: Pixy I2C Interface and Servo API (15min)
####_**Objective: Interface Zumo board with the Pixy board via I2C and the Pixy API, Explore servo arm articulation range**_
**Activity:** Students and Instructor write and run code to control the main LED on the Pixy board from Zumo board to verify that I2C communication between the boards is working properly.<br>
**Activity:** Students and Instructor write and run code to move the servo arm through it's maximum range of motion.

###Lecture: (15min)
####_**Objective: Understand how servos work, Pulse Width Modulation, View Examples of Industrial Robotic Arms**_
**Activity:** Video: [YuMi making paper planes](https://youtu.be/KWmTX9QotGk)<br>
**Activity:** Video: [Motor + Transmission + Control Circuit + Feedback](https://youtu.be/-XSXfqd1N58)<br>
**Activity:** Video: [Pulse Width Modulation](https://youtu.be/YmPziPfaByw)

###Lab: (60min)
####_**Objective: Move the servo arm continously**_
**Activity:** Students and Instructor implement a scan algorithm to provide camera coverage over the full range of arm motion<br>
