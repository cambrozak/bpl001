#Session Seven: Computer Vision and Feedback Control

###Lab: Pattern Recognition Training, Pixy API (15min)
####_**Objective: Train the Pixy vision sensor to recognize objects and use the Pixy API to display object coordinates on the LCD**_
**Activity:** Students train the robot to see various objects with PixyMon.<br>
**Activity:** Students and Instructor write and run code to access object location data in real time and display on the robot LCD.

###Lecture: (15min)
####_**Objective: Understand the concept of Feedback**_
**Activity:** Video: [Proportional Feedback](https://youtu.be/JEpWlTl95Tw?t=30s)<br>
**Activity:** Video: [Derivative Feedback](https://youtu.be/JEpWlTl95Tw?t=9m10s)

###Lab: (60min)
####_**Objective: Coordinate Vision Sensor, Servo and Motor Control for Autonomous Following**_
**Activity:** Students and Instructor write and run code to point at detected objects by coordinating servo arm movement with object location data.<br>
**Activity:** Students and Instructor improve servo arm movement with a Feedback library.<br>
**Activity:** Students and Instructor write code to integrate motor control with the servo feedback code.<br>
